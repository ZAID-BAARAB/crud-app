// this setupTests.ts file is used for global test setup in Jest. It runs automatically before each test file, allowing you to:
// - Configure global test utilities (e.g., React Testing Libraryâ€™s @testing-library/jest-dom).
// - Set up global mocks or polyfills.
// - Add custom matchers or global variables for your tests.
